#Setup
Extract all files where-ever you want and run the exe. The launcher should detect game path etc. automatically.  
You can use Tools > Import active mods for a quicker first time setup, if you want.


If the game does not correctly load mods, try deleting XComEngine.ini and XComModOptions.ini and starting the game normally to rebuild them.
